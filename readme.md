### Key Note

\*\*This API was developed along with the course "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023" in Udemy. While the project also has frontend components, my primary focus is learning and understanding the backend API's design and implementation. The most important part is that I have learned how to develop a RESTful API containing basic features in general web application such as:

- Authentication with JWT
- Secure Cookies
- Authorization with user roles
- Password encryption
- Custom error handling
- Files uploading
- Emails sending
- Payments acceptance
- etc.
